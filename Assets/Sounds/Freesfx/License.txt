What You CAN Use Our Sound Effects and Music For

You can use our sound effects and music in any commercial, non-commercial project including those that will be broadcast, including:

Films, television programmes and radio programmes.
YouTube videos. Because we now own the copyright (effective April 2016) for all of the content on our site we can now release any copyright flags that appear on your Youtube videos. If one of your videos is flagged, contact us by email and provide your Youtube Channel, or your account, and a link to the video in question. We will contact our internet watchdogs to have the infringement alert removed. You can still use the music with the infringement alert, but ads will be placed on your video - if that doesn't matter to you, it is okay with us because we get the revenue from the ad placements.
Websites, blogs and podcasts.
Games and apps (including iPhone, Android apps etc).
Exhibitions, conferences, museums etc.
In your school or college project.
